            At Legacy Growth Consulting LLC, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our content repurposing system, which integrates with your social media accounts and leverages AI technology to generate and manage content on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            When you access our service, we may collect basic account information such as your name, email address, and authentication credentials needed to securely connect your social media platforms.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            We may also access content that you have authorized us to use, such as posts, captions, media, and engagement data. This data is used only to deliver the services you have requested, including AI-generated content creation, content scheduling, and platform analysis. We do not permanently store this information unless you have explicitly enabled features that require retention, such as saved content drafts or scheduling queues.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            We do not knowingly collect or store sensitive personal data, and any data retrieved from connected platforms is processed in real-time and discarded once the intended task is complete. The AI interfaces we use analyze content inputs and generate outputs during your session, and these interactions are not retained without your consent.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            Our service may link to or integrate with third-party platforms such as Meta, LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and OpenAI. These services operate under their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review their terms and practices directly, as Legacy Growth Consulting LLC is not responsible for how these external services handle your data.
